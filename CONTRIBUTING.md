### Ready to make a change? Clone the repo and create a branch

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed

- Once you submit your PR, I will review it. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, I may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.

### Your PR is merged!

## Opening a pull request

You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also clone the repo locally, to view changes on your machine, or you can.

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:
- [ ] Be sure your animal is implemented with three methods
- [ ] You have already test the code with the command `yarn start` or `yarn dev`
- [ ] you have commit with respect of commitizen law.
- [ ] Make sure your branch is up-to-date and ready to merge.
